recipe:
  - Cook bacon in oil until crispy, remove and reserve. 
  - Season beef with salt and papper then brown in the bacon oil in batches if necessary
  - Remove beef from pan and brown the onion in the flavoured oil. 
  - Deglaze with a small amount of scotch. Not too much. 
  - Add carrot, garlic, potatoes, salt, pepper, and fry for 5 minutes on medium. 
  - Add a cup of red wine and allow to come to a boil to burn off some alcohol. 
  - Add crushed tomatoes (or ketchup if none), 1L of beef broth, bay leaves, thyme, worchestershire sauce 
  - Bring to a simmer, cover, and bake at 275F for two hours. 
  - Uncover and bake at 350F for 30 minutes to brown the top and boil off a little more alcohol. 
  - Zest the lemon into the broth and add salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste. 
notes:
  - probably add some worchester sauce at some point. 
  - A relatively fatty cut of beef works best as the fat will geletanize and keep it juicy. 
  - It is easy to bake this too long, in which case the potatoes will turn to mush. Its not the worst thing in the world, but annoying.
