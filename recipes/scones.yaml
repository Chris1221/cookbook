quantity: About a dozen
categories: [baking, breakfast]
ingredients:
  "butter": 110g
  "milk": 3/4 cup
  "cream": 1/2 cup
  "AP flour": 480g
  "sugar": 100g
  "baking powder": 2 tsp
  "egg": 2 + 1
  "salt": 2tsp
recipe:
  - Cut 110g of cold butter into chunks, sprinkle with flour and put back in the fridge.
  - add 3/4 cup of milk, 1/2 cup cream, 2 large cold eggs, whisk to break things up. 
  - Add 480g AP flour, 50g of sugar, tsp of salt, 2 tsp baking powder. sift and whisk. 
  - Make a well in the middle and put the butter in. Break up the butter into a sandy texture with your hands. 
  - Add the egg and milk mixture and mix together into a rough dough. Put into fridge. 
  - Knead slightly on a floured work surface and roll to one inch thick. divide into scones and place on baking mat.
  - Egg wash the top and sprinkle with sugar. 
  - Bake at 375F for ~ 20-30 minutes, checking to see if done

notes:
  - I doubled the amount of sugar to have a sweet edge and added salt. Vanilla extract in the wet ingredients is completely optional but I find that it helps a bit with the savouriness.
  - Baking time was originally listed as 15 minutes but I find that with the ~1 inch thickness that isnt really sufficient. I put it in for 20 then check it every 5 minutes until golden on top.
  - Letting the dough rest in the fridge after mixing is really helpful for shaping and also makes the scones fluffier.
