name: Sean's Tofu
description: Fried tofu smothered in a savoury and sweet sauce flavoured with five spice
time: 20-30 minutes 
quantity: 2 portions
categories: [chinese, sides]
ingredients:
  Medium-firm tofu: One block
  Five spice: Pinch
  Rock sugar: 1 tsp
  Honey: 1 tsp
  Hoisin or Oyster sauce: 1 tbsp 
  Light soy sauce: 1 tbsp
  Liao jiu: 1 tbsp 
  Salt: pinch
  White pepper: pinch
  Water (or stock): 200ml 
  Cilantro: handful 
recipe:
  - Optionally, press tofu for better browning.
  - Slice tofu lengthwise into 1cm sheets 
  - Mix the sauce (five spice, sugar and honey, oyster sauce + soy sauce + liao jiu in 1:1:1 ratio) with a pinch of salt and white pepper.
  - Bring to a simmer to disolve the honey and mix with the water or stock. Reduce to just above a syrop-like consistency (~10 minutes).
  - Dry the sheets of tofu with paper towel and fry in oil until brown on either side.
  - Deglaze with the sauce and simmer together for a few minutes.
  - Serve topped with cilantro. 
notes:
  - The sugar might be too high in the sauce. I also think it would do great with a little bit of chopped birds eye chili as garnish.
  - Thank you Sean!
