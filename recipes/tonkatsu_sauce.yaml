name: Tonkatsu Sauce
description: This may be a bit of an abomination but it hits just the right spot. The honey especially brings a beautiful brightness to the sauce that I love over savoury deep fried pork.
time: Like two seconds
quantity: Enough for 2 katsu cutlets 
categories: [Japanese, dinner, sauces]
ingredients:
  ketchup: 3 tbsp
  Worchestershire sauce: 1 tbsp
  hot english mustard: 1 tsp
  soy sauce: 1 tsp 
  oyster sauce: 1 tsp
  honey: 1 tsp
recipe:
  - Combine and pour on top of tonkatsu. 
  
notes:
  - Tone down the mustard if you don't like mustard 
  - The amounts here are completely made up, this is entirely to taste. Taste it and see! 
  - This is very much a 'quick' version, I really want to try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemGT3NWmBo">this</a> at some point when I'm making tonkatsu for more than a weeknight dinner.
