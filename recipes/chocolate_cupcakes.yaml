name: Chocolate cupcakes
description: Very nice recipe from Tasty Kitchen that takes a little bit longer but is always worth it.
time: 30 minutes
quantity: 18 medium sized cupcakes
categories: [baking, dessert]
ingredients:
  "sour cream (room temperature)":  1/4 cup (60g)
  "buttermilk room temperature": 1/2 cup (120ml)
  "eggs": 2 medium
  "veggie oil":  1/3 cup (80ml)
  "hot coffee":  1/4 cup (60ml)
  "vanilla extract": 2 tsp
  "all-purpose flour": 1.5 cups (180g)
  "granulated sugar": 265g
  "cocoa powder": 20g 
  "baking soda": 1 tsp (6g)
  "kosher salt":  1/2 tsp (2.5g)
recipe:
  - Combine dry and wet separately. The dough will be very wet, that's okay. 
  - Bake for 20 minutes at 350F in cupcake papers. 
  - Top with icing. 

notes: 
  - A good workaround for the buttermilk is to combine about a tsp or two of lemon juice with regular 2% milk. This curdles it and gives it the right flavour. 
  - Don't overfill the cups, go about halfway up otherwise the dough will rise out of the pan and collapse. It's not the end of the world but the size is nice when filled half way.
