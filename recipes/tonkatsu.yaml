name: Tonkatsu
description: Deep fried pork cutlet. Check out my recipe for tonkatsu sauce and pair with a cabbage salad and Chinese pickles. 
time: An hour, though maybe 20 minutes of active time
quantity: 2 cutlets 
categories: [Japanese, dinner]
ingredients:
  pork: two cutlets 
  eggs: two
  flour: 150g
  panko: 150g 
recipe:
  - About an hour before you want to eat, generously salt the pork in a dry brine. 
  - Using two tooth picks, liberally stab holes in the cutlets to tenderize them. The alternative is to beat them with the back of a knife but I don't like how thin this makes them.
  - After about half an hour, heat oil to approx 350F.
  - Beat the egg and put in a bowl, along with a bowl of flour and a bowl of panko. 
  - Using a tooth pick, alternate between dipping the cutlet in flour and the egg 2-3 times. 
  - Finally press the panko into the coating and deep fry for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown on the outside and 150-160F in the interior. 
  - Drain on paper towels sideways if possible and sprinkle with flaky salt. Serve with cabbage salad and/or rice.
  
notes:
  - Cut the flour with corn starch for a marginally more crunchy result.
