categories: [korean, dinner, easy]
ingredients:
  "brown sugar, packed": 1/3 cup
  "soy sauce": 1/2 cup 
  "sesame oil": 1 tablespoon
  "red pepper flakes": 1/2 teaspoon (but I usually use a lot more)
  "ground ginger": 1/4 teaspoon
  "garlic, minced": 3 cloves
  "ground beef": 1 pound
  "green onions, thinly sliced": 2
recipe:
  - In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes and ginger.
  - Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat. Stir in soy sauce mixture and green onions until well combined, allowing to simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.
  - Serve immediately with rice.

  
notes:
  - Clearly, the flavour is mostly based on the huge amounts of both soy sauce and brown sugar. The sesame oil is crucial for taking it away from that really basic taste, and I like to load up the chili peppers as well.  
  - The exact same recipe can make a pretty taste bulgogi with actual sliced beef.
