name: Nun's Farts
description: Google tells me that this is a French Canadian desert, but we're not French Canadian. With a little glaze of icing on top they become Nun's Kisses which is a little more pleasing of a description. 
time: 1.5 hours
quantity: A cookie tray full (about 20 in total)
categories: [baking, desert]
ingredients:
  all purpose flour: 150g
  cold butter: 100g
  cold water: 50g
  brown sugar: 65g
  melted butter: 20g
  cinnamon: 1tsp
recipe:
  - Make the pie dough first. Cut cold butter into small cubes and rub into flour, making a sandy consistency. Mix the water in and barely knead together before dumping onto plastic wrap and pressing into a square. This will hydrate more as it rests.
  - Rest in the fridge for an hour.
  - Preheat the oven to 400F and start making the filling by mixing the brown sugar and cinnamon together with just enough melted butter for it to form a sandy consistency. If you add too much butter, it just melts out.
  - Roll the pie dough out to about a mm thick and spread on some melted butter. Cover the dough with the filling (skipping the bottom inch or so) and roll into a log.
  - Cut into small rolls about a cm thick and bake at 400F for 15 minutes. 
  
notes:
  - The original recipe that my mom uses just spreads melted butter and tops it with cinnamon and sugar, but I find that by mixing the butter in with the sugar you get a more concentrated flavour in the filling. Probably its just more sugar. 
  - To make into Nun's Kisses, make a glaze with a cup of icing sugar and just enough water to make a thick paste. Drizzle on top or dip the rolls in the glaze and you're done.
