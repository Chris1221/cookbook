name: Mapo Tofu
description: Ma la tofu in a deliciously thick sauce. 
time: An hour
quantity: 2 portions 
categories: [chinese]
ingredients:
  soft tofu: 1lb
  green onion: 2 
  ground pork: 100g
  pixian dou ban jiang (minced): 1.5 tbsp 
  garlic (minced): 4-5 cloves
  chicken stock: 3/4 cup
recipe:
  - Drain tofu and cut into 2cm cubes; blanch in a lightly salted pot of water and let sit. 
  - Heat three tablespoons of cooking oil in a wok and fry the pork. Add the doubanjiang and simmer gently to release the oil and stain the sauce a deep red. 
  - Add minced garlic and Chinese chili powder (other chili powders are too mild, IMHO). 
  - Fry together until fragrant, then add in chicken stock, a tsp soy sauce, a tsp of liao jiu, and a few tsps of sugar. 
  - Simmer until slightly thickened then fold in the tofu. 
  - Add ground sichuan peppercorn and a tsp of black vinegar. 
  - Thicken with cornstarch slurry and finish with sesame oil and a pinch of ground sichuan peppercorn on top. 
  
notes:
  - The ground pork is best ground by hand using two cleavers; with such a small amount it takes very little time.
  - Sichuan peppercorn powder is best also ground by hand by first frying in a dry wok until fragrant and leaving oil droplets then grinding in a mortal and pestle (the smell is incredible).
  - Fermented black bean paste is also traditional and can be added after the doubanjiang. I've unfortunately never had any on hand while making this. 
  - This recipe is a mixture between the Chinese Cooking Demystified approach and Fuscia Dunlop's version. There are some minor differences in technique that I averaged over.
