name: Korean Beef Bone Broth Soup
description: A low-and-slow bone broth turned into a hearty soup.
time: 10 hours
quantity: A couple of liters of soup
categories: [long, dinner, Korean]
ingredients:
  "beef bones": 2lbs
  "fatty beef": 1lb 
  "onion": 1 large
  "korean radish": half
  "green onions": 4-5
  "garlic": 1/2 head
recipe:
  - Wash beef bones and your choice of fatty beef in cold water and let stand for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This helps to draw out blood, improving the colour of the final product. 
  - Rinse meat, then boil in water for approximately 10 minuteswith an inch of smashed ginger. Once the water is no longer clear, and scum has risen to the surface, discard the boiling water and once again wash the beef to remove unwanted discolourants. 
  - Thoroughly wash the pot, place the beef inside and cover with water. Cut an onion in half along with the Korean radish, if available. 
  - Simmer on a low heat for three hours, then remove the fatty beef and vegetables.
  - Continue to simmer the bones by themselves for an additional three hours, optionally skimming fat from the surface. 
  - Once finished, optionally keep simmering the bones for another three hours.
  - To make the soup, shred the beef and mix with chili flakes, salt, green onions, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil to taste. 
  
notes:
  - Inspired by a Maangchi video with a few modifications. 
  - Almost any root vegetable can be substituted in the original boiling stage, so long as it contributes a nice flavour towards the final broth. I have used bok choy successfully here as well, just use whatever is available.
