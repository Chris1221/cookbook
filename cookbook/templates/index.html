Since trying, and failing, to use many different applications to harmonize my growing collection of "things", <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">I 
decided to write my own</a>. This website is about halfway between an incoherant free-form note and a structured database of things that are interesting to me. 
Here you can browse 
<a href="recipes.html">a list of all my recipes</a> and <a href= "{{ url_for('cookbook.all_trips') }}">a collection of trip logs</a> from my camping adventures. The intention
is to take the extremely simple template format that I've adopted here (more details below) and keep track of things that I want to remember. The changelog below is automatically
updated, just in case you ever find yourself here again. Thanks for stopping by.


<h4>Technical summary</h4>

The application is fully written in flask, though I wanted to host it on a static server. 
To accomplish this, I used a combination of Flask-Freeze and CirlceCI with gh-pages to both make the site static and
automatically deploy to github pages whenever I push to the repository. Recipes are described through 
an extremely simple YAML markup with flexible fields that can be omitted if desired. 
Tags are rendered out seperately and are linked to the recipes they belong to.
Other than that, I lifted some CSS from the al-folio 
jekyll theme that I use for my main site. If curious, the website is open source on Github.
